# Identifying_Music_Genre
How many times we have wondered, what might have been a songs genre, sometimes it might be easy and sometimes it might make our brains go wild, so this is it, this program allows us to predict the genre of the music using Transfer learning. The flow is as follows first we load the music file, split the songs into chunks, then load the model using load model (), using the loaded model, predict on the music which you ahve loaded earlier and since the output will be in the form of array, we use argmax() to extract the highest probability of the music genre the model has predicted.
